- CameraThread: Integrate more advanced deinterlacing methods, such as those in http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/

- Integrate Qt Graphics Dojo blog - htmleditor - into editing text
- Add fade in/out offsets

- Add read signal for prop editors - even more important now with key framing , etc
	- tried, not working right now
	
- For videos, add a timeline, and pause/play/ff/rw actions
- Add mouse support to GLWidget for picking, moving
- Add cross fading for text and static sources
- Add canvas size setting methods 
- Add "camera" point (viewport) movement...?

- Add 'draw a border' around video if desired (for position on screen)

- Add text scroller methods


- Video file playlist - doesnt save deletes/moves for some reason

- Location Editor:
	- needs to always work in pixels
	- Move the alignment stuff out of GLDrawable and into LiveLayer
	- Move the show/hide animations out of GLDrawable and Into LiveLayer (maybe......)
	- ADD MOUSE MOVE/RESIZE!
	
As of 2010-10-14: In Debug.lmx, the middle 'squares2.png' layer doesnt restore its position after load UNTIL I edit the width - then it properly restores rect

Structure:
	- Components of the LiveMix system:
		lmx-player
			Standalone player, reads lmx-player.ini in current directory by default, -c to specify different config.
			.ini file specifies:
				[window]
					window size - where on the screen to draw the output
				[source]
					either:
						A livemix controller URI, such as 'controller=lmxctrl1.domain.local:7547'
						A list of .lmx layer files to play in sequence, such as:
							num-files=5
							file1: logo.lmx
							file2: video1.lmx
							file3: adroll.lmx
							
							An overlay file can be specified with:
							overlay: branding.lmx
							
							Background layer that is kept behind all other layers:
							background: my-bg.lmx
							
			Need some higher-level concepts:
				A "layout" that "tacks" different layers into position
					Changing between layouts applies pre-defined transition effects to the layouts (slide in/out, etc)
					Each "area" of the layout has at least one LiveWidget item on it
						The widget item defines the user-modifiable controls at runtime (communicates with the controller via IP)
							These controls are two way - they accept changes from the user and communicate values to the user:
								Example: A video player
									From User: play/pause commands, seek
									To user: Current time in the video
						The widget item also exposes scheduleable properties
							E.g. At YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, the content of property 'X' should be 'Y'
						Existing LiveLayer-derived objects can implement the LiveWidget interface by:
							[TBD]
							
						
						Each LiveWidget defines a calculated contentDuration property based on the total duration of all elements in its playlist
							//If the playlist has absolute date/times in it, then the duration is the difference between the oldest time and the latest time
							Playlist can be changed via a schedule - e.g. a new playlist is assigned to the liveiwdget at a certain time, etc
							
				Schedule:
					Changes the layout in the player
					Or the playlist of a widget
					Or shows/hides a root elemnt of the layout
					Or set a specific property on a widget
					
					
					
				Playlist data types:
					LiveVideoFileLayer:
						List of Video Files (Duration Explicit, in/out times can be edited)
					LiveStaticSourceLayer:
						List of Image Files (Duration Explicit)
					LiveTextLayer:
						List of Strings (Duration Explicit)
					LiveVideoInputLayer:
						List of Camera Devices (Duration Explcit)
						
				Other user controllable properties:
					(All: Play list (current item/next/prev,pause/play), (add/del,move up/down))
					(All: Visible/Hidden)
					LiveVideoFileLayer:
						Volume Level
