- CameraThread: Integrate more advanced deinterlacing methods, such as those in http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/
- VideoWidget: Adaptivly adjust fade speed during fading to make the predicted clock alight with the real speed (either speed up/slow down)

- Property Editors:
	Add 'read' signal or something like that to update the property values
	
- Add geometry anchor points
- Add geometry anchor inset
- Add file chooser for static overlay
- Add video input chooser
- Integrate Qt Graphics Dojo blog - htmleditor - into editing text
- Fix text jumpiness - jumps as you type on screen somtimes
- Add drag/drop z value changing
- Add fade in/out offsets
- Start out all layer types with just fade in/out animations, no funky stuff
- Start out all layers with full screen rects

BUGS:
- fix text:
	when clicking edit on text, it reverts back to the original setup position
	have to re-click alignment to get it to work
- Opacity slider in props doesnt match opacity as set by control widget
- Control widget should update opacity when it changes in props



Structure:

	Output
	
	Switch to one or more layer "setups"
	
	
	
---------------------------------


before nap I was doing:
	- loading three.livemix doesnt:
		- restore alignment setting
		- restore in/out advanced settings
		- start playing video even tho file was set
		- leaks memory, probably due to video
	- confirm if it loads Z value correctly
		- doesnt seem to sort correctly if it does load
also check on signals not connecting msgs on console

----
still leaking memory in VideoThread and no image showing
still crashes when creating a camera
	seems to crash in GLDrawable when calling scanLine on the video frame .image
		should be a raw frame - why is it using .image??

memory corruption around edges of text rects - whats up with that??
