BUGS:
- fix text:
	when clicking edit on text, it reverts back to the original setup position
	have to re-click alignment to get it to work
- Opacity slider in props doesnt match opacity as set by control widget
- Control widget should update opacity when it changes in props



Structure:

	Output
	
	Switch to one or more layer "setups"
	
	

memory corruption around edges of text rects - whats up with that??
	only on centos...
text sometimes doesnt load and set correct rect (too small sometimes)
loading file will start editing a layer, but not show drawable until clicking ANOTHEr layer to edit, then back to orig
