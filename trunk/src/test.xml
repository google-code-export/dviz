        <text>Verse 1
Alas, and did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head,
For such a worm as I. 

Verse 2
Was it for crimes that I have done,
He suffered on the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown,
And love beyond degree! 

Verse 3
Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in;
When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man, the creature's sin. 

Verse 4
Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears;
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt mine eyes to tears. 

Verse 5
But drops of grief can ne'er repay,
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,

He's alive alive alive
Hallelujah alive
Praise and glory to the Lamb
Alive alive alive hallelujah
Alive forever amen

Chorus 2
I'm alive alive alive
Hallelujah alive
Praise and glory to the Lamb
Alive alive alive hallelujah
Alive forever amen

Verse 1
Let the children sing
A song of liberation
The God of our salvation
Set us free
Death where is thy sting
The curse of sin is broken
The empty tomb stands open
Come and see

Verse 2
Let my heart sing out
For Christ the One and only
So powerful and holy
Rescued me
Death won't hurt me now
Because He has redeemed me
No grave will ever keep me
From my King

BRIDGE
Worthy is the Lamb
Worthy of our praise
Worthy is the One
Who has overcome the grave
Let the people dance
Let the people sing
Worthy is the mighty King

Worthy is the Lamb
Worthy of our praise
Worthy is the One
Who has overcome the grave
Let the people dance
Let the people sing

        <text>Verse 1
Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His Name?

Verse 2
Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Verse 3
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?

Verse 4
Sure I must fight if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord.
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
