Directed Visual System (DViz)

Release 1.0 Feature Target List
----

	"Basic Presentational Tool"
	
	
	Just the basics necessary to replace EasyWorship for use at PHC
		Currently we use EW for:
			- Song Lyrics
				- Cases:
					- Praise Songs
					- Hymnals
				- In future, improve by importing text from PPT and auto-lookup lyrics for hymns online
				- To replace EW, just need:
					- basic block lyric support
					- animated or static backgrounds
					- centered text within rectangle
					- Text shadows (structure there, just need to write it)
					- Text outline (got it)
					- Song Database 
					- Lyric editor like EW (one long block of text, translated to slides behind the scenes)
					- Unlike EW, do NOT honor RTF codes in lyric editor
					- Foldback support
						- Right now, we stream a screencap to a second PC to VidBlaster which handles rear projection
						- For R1.0, networked DViz viewer would be ideal
						- This implies we need some way to handle foldback generation in the software:
							 - For songs, easy - we're auto-making the slides
							 	Two ways we could do it:
							 		- Slide "filters" on foldback output
										- Filter on Item Type or Item Tag
										- Then we just generate slides with appros tags, etc
										- Filters could be exclusionary (dont show item IF)
										- Implies filter on front slide as well to hide content only for rear output
									- Custom output generator for rear output based on SlideGroup code
										- Lookup GraphicsScene generator from slidegroup type
										- If none found, use data straight (or fall thru to slide filter)
										- If found custom generator, feed it the front slidegroup and current slide
										- Then add the data from the generator to the rear slide
										- This allows the custom generator to add in the next line text, etc
							- For other slides, the "foldback" (or rear output) could: 
								- CHEAT: mirror front content or strip all but text items
								- Do it Right: Implement above filters/custom generator
								- Hard part about filters for other types:
									- Consider this though too: Filters should not only hide/show stuff, but modify also
									  the SIZE of the text, color, positional stuff (center, left, etc), weight
									- Filters on other types:
										- Need way in editor then to add "tags" to items
										- Tags can be "inherited" from amster slides too
			- Scripture Reading (Responsive Reading)
				- Leader reads a passage, audience reads a passage - alternating slides
				- EW has not been good at this because it doesnt support any other "slides" other than songs
				- Currently, we use powerpoint with scripture text, and just mirror PPT to rear wall
				- Out of the gate, we will be "better" because we are building off of slides
				- To "beat" EW, we just need "cleaned text" support on rear wall, stripped of foreground
				- To match EW, we just need:
					- Static image background
					- Text block (already have that)
					- Text shadows (structure there, just need to write it)
					- Text outline (got it)
			- Announcment Loops (before/after)
				- Right now, we just import PPT slides and play in a loop
				- To match basic PPT capabilities as used by the announcment loops, we need:
					- text blocks (got it)
					- shadows on text blocks (got basic shadows, gausian blur would be nice)
					- centering text in block (should be easy to do (cross fingers))
					- layout assist: center block vert/horizontal (should be very easy)
					- snap to grid (basic code there in AbstractContent, need to add suppor tin other positional methods)
					- lines (thin rects will "do" it, but need a true line item)
					- image backgrounds (should be easy, nothing yet) 
					- rectangles with transparency and line support
					- gradients (infrastructure there, need editor or lots of good built-ins)
					- undo/redo framework
					- "master" slides (for use with dates on every slide, logo on bottom, etc)
						- Dont *HAVE* to have master slides - can fake it, but need copy/paste (or clone) support real good then
				- Out of the gate, improve ppt by:
					- master slide items Z value can be higher than on the actual slides
					- video items (already have them)
				- Future:
					- animations
			- Sermons Graphics:
				- Right now, we again import PPT slides 
				- This makes heavy use of gradient backgrounds, smooth cross fades, and "random access" to slides
				- Need all the "match ppt" items from announcment loops
				- Out of the gate, beat PPT by allowing in-flight slide updates:
					- Three step update to slide on screen 
						- target for time to publish (from start of search in control to show button): 10 seconds
							- Select slide in control - either edit, or copy=and=edit
							- Make changes
							- One button "show slide"
						- This is the single biggest problem I have with the EW/PPT combo - the time it takes to update a slide in-flight
					- Video Items/bg (probably not use this tho, too distracting)
				- Future beat PPT:
					again, animations
					
	Stuff we do at PHC that would be nice to have integrated:
		- Foldback support (see discussion under songs)
		- House TVs
			Modes:
				- Overlay live camera feed with PiP from Main Screens (Camera can be either PiP for songs, or Background for Sermon)
				- Just mirror front (for announcement loops)
				- Just camera (when main screens are black but people are on platform talking, etc)
			Main show stopper:
				- live camera support
			Discussion:
				- The PiP stuff can be done by setting up different slides in a slidegroup for the config wanted
					- Use the camera as a background or foreground item as desired
				- Then just transition between the slides
				- This would need either:
					- An "item" that is really a network feed from remote dviz:
						- Either multipart jpeg (the cheating way :-)
						- Or remote model with sync commands
							- How to integrate model into a single item?
							- Easiest way would be to embed a QGraphicsView using a WidgetProxy in the Item
								- Then just set it up with a MyGraphicsScene, feed it the remote model and setup sync commands
							- Other methods?
					- House TVs just as a remote dviz viewer, but content all from main control
						- Slightly easier - then the scene is full screen
						- But consider camera latency - transmitting images over the wire
						- Maybe make the camera item able to take the capture from the machine its "playing" on, not from control
							- e.g. thinkg of it as "relative" data - relative to the machine its on
							- in contrast, "absolute" data would be from control
		- Secondary Feed 
			- still expiermental right now
			- Childrens Church during the sermon is in the gymnasium
			- Need a way to indicate to them when the sermon is done from the control booth
			- A buzzer would be one way, but I dont want to distract the kids - only to let the leader know 
			- A flashing light might work - modify a buzzer to show a light instead
			- Or the "high tech way" would be a laptop connected to a screen running a remote dviz viewer
			- Then just send a slide to that output when nearly done
				- The "cats pajamas" would be to have a live webcam connected to that dviz viewer laptop, 
					feed images back over the net to control
				- Thinking of that, that would be nice 
					- the remote dviz viewers could spawn the capture thread
					- use the capture in local slides (see "relative data", above)
					- and include the ability to send the image back over the network to control for viewing there
					- *OR* just mod the control to be able to include resources (sound cap, vid cap) from remote
						dviz viewers into local presentations, or slids showing on other dviz viewers

		FEATURES NEED IMPLEMENTED FROM LIST ABOVE:
			Everything except first two :-)
			

	Closing:
		This would be Release 1.0 - "Dviz - Basic Presentational Tool" or "DBPT", that is "Daily Breakfast Post Toasties", or, the "Tasty Breakfast" Release
		Relase 1.5 will build in "enhancements" that go beyond EW/PPT combo
		 
	Milestone Breakdown:
		The feature list for can be broken down cleanly into:
			Songs/Scripture Reading - Target
				- Easily implemented using current visual infrastructure
				- Just need to add the lyric / scripture abstraction (Song Database)
				- Needs "Easy" visual additions: Cross Fades, Shadows, Backgrounds, Random-Access viewer control
			Announcments/Sermon Powerpoints
				- This is the more general milestone
				- Needs the more general/more work visual items (images, snap to grid, layout assist, gradients, master slides)
				- Needs in-flight edits 
				
			----
			At this point, we can "break" and use Dviz is we *have* to, just geting by with 
			the current VidBlaster remote infrastructure for foldback and inhouse
				
			In fact, this could be release 1.0. Then the next two milestones make up release 1.5:
			----
			
			TARGET FOR 1.0: October 5th, 2009
			
			---
			Relase 1.5:
			---
			
			Foldback Support
				- Harder, more ambigeous
				- Needs the slide filter/custom generator
				- Remember: Would like to include only-foldback text, say in songs, like guitar tabs, etc
				- Blank/Clear Buttons (only here because clear would make use of the foldback text abstraction)
			Camera/Secondary
				- Getting into the difficult/complex remote viewer
				- Camera capture on windows - oofta
				- Remote scene inclusion - oofta
			---
			
			TARGET FOR 1.5: End of October, Mid November
