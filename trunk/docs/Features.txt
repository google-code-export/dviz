Revised Task list for Release 1.0, 10/10/09:
	----------------------------
	"Tasty Breakfast" Release
	----------------------------
	Target Use Cases: 
	Songs, Announcements, Sermon
	----------------------------
	
	- Models:
		[DONE] - Song Database Model
			[DONE] - SQLite Backend 
	- Logic:
		[DONE] - Translator/Slide Generator
			[DONE] - Given a Song, translate into a slide group
	- UI:
		- List of forms needed:
			[ALMOST] - "Grid and Guidelines" Form
			- Slide Group settings (aspect ratio, etc)
			[DONE] - Song Editor
		[DONE] - SongDatabase List View
			- One column
			#- Three columns:
			#	- Title, #, Tags (Chorus, Hymn, etc)
		[DONE] - Search Function:
			[NOT IMPL] - Default to Full Text, Sort by Title
				- only implemented title search, but can match any part of title and can use wildcards
			#- Title
			#- Name
			#- Full Text
		[DONE] - Random access viewer control
			[DONE] - Just do it
			[DONE] - Should be "smart" - for songs, render differently than generic slide groups
			[DONE] - Go by Group Type?
		[*] - In-flight edits
			- need to add specific framework for this
	- Visuals:
		[DONE] - Add Aspect Ratio setting
		[DONE] - Text Centering in a Text Box
		[LATER?] - Undo/redo framework
			- Must have this for sermons and announcment slides
		[*] - Snap to grid support
		[*] - Increse/decrease size of font from toolbar - needed for sermon/announcment
			- see code in textboxcontent.cpp for cursor usage
		- Copy/paste or duplicate slides
		- Layout asissts - center objects vert/horz
			- need hint for this (e.g. songs) to auto adjust - maybe?
		- Image Item
			- Should be easy
			- If we have time, add crop handles
		- SVG Item if we have time
		[DONE] - Cross Fade on Changing Slide
			[DONE] - Important Point:
				[DONE] - Need to abstract video source/decoder to a "singleton" 
				[DONE] - Once source/decoder for that file per program
			[DONE] - When slide*Group* is set on scene, need to scan and initalize decoders for all videos, but STOP at first frame
			[DONE] - When cross fade starts, start playing
			[DONE] - Stop playing prev slide when cross fade ends
			[DONE] - Dont Release provider unless slide group is taken off scene?
		[DONE] - Shadows (Text):
			[DONE] - Can settle for simple block shadow
			[LATER] - Gausian blur if we have time 
		[DONE] - Backgrounds:
			[DONE] - Add background item type & Position automatically, Disable movement
			[DONE] - Still cant set item color/props with config box
		[LATER] - Gradients - can settle for making gradients in gimp and import as photo, but need to eventually have support direclty in dviz
	
	- Improvements:
		Auto-change slides/slide groups after X seconds
		Need to add drag-drop from song list to song group
		Add outputview objects to encapsulate slidegroupviewer or network client/server
		Crop handles should be easy - as move left in, move X out. Basically keep the image rect the same (or add negative offsets)
		On first start, intelligently detect aspect ratio of primary output - if no primary out, create small custom rect in top right
		Global cache pixmaps
		Consider moving opengl option to a per-output setting
		Consider making Output objects QObjects that can emit signals when changed
		
		[DONE] Need to implement song editor
		[DONE] Look at setting char format thru cursor and using text document to render
		[DONE] In video content/bg: dont reject image if m_still is set UNLESS also has m_size>0 already
		[REJECTED] Need to change double click on song list to send straight to live
		[REJECTED] Add editing to slide group/slide model lists in the list itself (e.g. to change slide/group title)
		[LATER] Audio with videos
		[LATER] Per-verse custom slides - key to header OR passage#
		[LATER] Master overlay - add "disable master overlay" to slide group option box
		[LATER] Script plugin item
		
	- Bugs:
		On windows, when setting video item live, it doesnt play unless you dbl-click the slide again
		Win32: If blank document "<document/>", crash when add group then click group
		Win32: When starting with no document (test.xml), closing program results in "cannot write to ''" (should prompt to save as)
		Win32: File->New crashes
		Starting new results in incorrect AR for "new" doc - doc should adopt current live AR
		Shadow option has no effect on box object - either remove tab or enable shaodw
		Turning on/off line has no effect on box 
		Turning on/off bg has no effect on box
		Changing AR doesn't resize background elements of slides in document - probably should automatically
		Auto-sizing song text should be an option that can be enabled/disabled
		Document list icons need to be lot smaller
		Perfomance of the document pixmap model generator becomes a problem with a lot of songs - need to investigate - possibly use different cache key
		
		
		[FIXED] text config box text is white - maybe need to get html from model item for editing??
		[FIXED] Song cross fade / go live performance is terrible
		[HACK-FIX] Slide editor -> new slide doesnt show slide in list model again!
		[FIXED] When go live, auto select the current live slide
		[WORKSFORME] Slide in icon preview for slide group isnt always the first slide
		[FIXED] When changing output size with custom output, output disappers until program restart
		[FIXED] When using 1.6AR, content locations centered in slide editor appear off center in preview and live (but correct in icons)
		[FIXED] Somtimes going live with video item it doesnt play
		[FIXED] When setting video in slide editor, it never shows first frame
		[FIXED] Video slides crashing when made live on Win32
		[FIXED] When changing AR, reload document (or recreate slides)
		[FIXED] Songs need to be vertically centered as well
		[FIXED] Cross fading text with shadows shows ugly "dark" text during crossfade - need to investigate clipping shadow to only visible part of painter path
		[FIXED] When dbl click on a FILTERED song list, the song clicked comes from the UNFILTERED list (e.g. its not the song clicked)
		[FIXED] Major problems with song list display
		[FIXED] Song Text not being layed out properly with the "center" functionality (text being clipped, etc) - Can't use <br> tags I fond out.
		[HACK-FIX] Song slide preview has lines that are "too thick"
		[FIXED] Song text on output is too far to the top-left (but preview is fine) - aspect ratio was set wrong and had to adjustViewScaling when chaged
		[FIXED] Need to set item name in slide generator for songs
		[FIXED] Need to set item id in slide generator
		[FIXED] Songs aren't being converted toXml properly (is toXml virtual??)
			made it virtual, but still doesn't seem to be saving - tbd -
			needed to match the function signatures exactly - in this case, toXml was missing the 'const' from the original defn
		[FIXED] When another slide live first, then trans to video slide, single click (preview) different slide, the live item stops playing
		[FIXED] Centered TextBox items appear too far to the left in icon previews (list models, etc)
		[FIXED] Setting config on background item causes it to "go away" until program reload
		[FIXED] Output Dialog should have all tabs on left disabled until output selected, otherwise SIGSEGV if user clicks screen list before selecting output
		[FIXED] new slide button stopped working
		[WORKSFORME] slide editor crash when add box then delete box
		[FIXED] slide listbox cant scroll down below the fold
		[WORKSFORME] figure out why some items (VideoFileContent for now) jumps position vertically when slide changes
		[FIXED] figure out why mirror item doesnt get repainted when slide changed back
		[FIXED] turn off multi-select unless intentional - looks like if one item selected, then right-click on another item, it selects both items
		[FIXED] repaint bug -see textitem - when textobx selected and hover over other content, bg in text box turns white...why?
		[FIXED] (r86) -since textbox clipping has been turned on, need to keep all text inside content rect - add margin or something to layout - see letter "L" in tahoma at start of a box
