Revised Task list for Release 1.0, 10/10/09:
	---------------------------
	"Tasty Breakfast" Release
	---------------------------
	Target Use Cases: 
	Songs, Announcments, Sermon
	---------------------------
	
	- Models:
		- Song Database Model
			- SQLite Backend 
	- Logic:
		- Translator/Slide Generator
			- Given a Song, translate into a slide group
	- UI:
		- SongDatabase List View
			- Three columns:
				- Title, #, Tags (Chorus, Hymn, etc)
		- Search Function:
			- Default to Full Text, Sort by Title
			- Title
			- Name
			- Full Text
		- Random access viewer control
			- Just do it
			- Should be "smart" - for songs, render differently than generic slide groups
			- Go by Group Type?
			- Think about custom foldback generator - this is just a custom viewer control generator needed
		- In-flight edits
	- Visuals:
		- Text Centering in a Text Box
		- Undo/redo framework
			- Must have this for sermons and announcment slides
		- Copy/paste or duplicate slides
		- Snap to grid support
		- Increse/decrease size of font from toolbar - needed for sermon/announcment
		- Layout asissts - center objects vert/horz
		- Image Item
			- Should be easy
			- If we have time, add crop handles
		- Cross Fade on Changing Slide
			- Important Point:
				- Need to abstract video source/decoder to a "singleton" 
				- Once source/decoder for that file per program
			- When slide*Group* is set on scene, need to scan and initalize decoders for all videos, but STOP at first frame
			- When cross fade starts, start playing
			- Stop playing prev slide when cross fade ends
		- Shadows (Text):
			- Can settle for simple block shadow
			- Gausian blur if we have time 
		- Backgrounds:
			- We could cheat and just generate a foreground item positioned correctly
			- Need support for a slide background item, for use with announcments/sermons
			- Think about how fotowall did it
		- SVG Item if we have time
		- Gradients - can settle for making gradients in gimp and import as photo, but need to eventually have support direclty in dviz
	- Bugs:
		-slide editor crash when add box then delete box
		-slide listbox cant scroll down below the fold
		-figure out why some items (VideoFileContent for now) jumps position vertically when slide changes
		-figure out why mirror item doesnt get repainted when slide changed back
		-turn off multi-select unless intentional - looks like if one item selected, then right-click on another item, it selects both items
		-repaint bug -see textitem - when textobx selected and hover over other content, bg in text box turns white...why?
		[FIXED]-r86-since textbox clipping has been turned on, need to keep all text inside content rect - add margin or something to layout - see letter "L" in tahoma at start of a box
