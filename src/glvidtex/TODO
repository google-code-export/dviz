TODO:
	BUGS:
		- [FIXED] When viewing remote using vid send/receiver thru a VideoWidget, one of the video streams seems to 'back up' and only "unspools" when sent live thru a GLVideoDrawable... ???
			- Disabled buffering on VideoReceiver - hackish fix, I know.
		- [DONE] Live monitor from player seems to be buffered - check on that
		- [DONE] Change the shortcut key in the file menu in director for the Connections and Live Monitor (both use "C")
		- [TMP-FIX] Video Encoding "problems"
			- Way to much CPU usage - 157%-ish on a dual-core 2.4 GHz...causing live video to stutter
			- Consider putting it either in another thread or in a whole other process with shared memory
				- Can we push it off onto the network somehow??
			- Temporarily disabled encoder in PlayerWindow till this is addressed.
		- [CANTFIX] Need to push text rendering into another thread, causing live video to stutter (see the 4fps clock over live video)
			- Optimized as much as I can right now, but rendering still takes ~80-100ms with shadow and outline
			- Can't push QTextDocument into another thread for some reason
			- Added a 'cached image' feature for transmitting text from director to player so the player won't have to re-render static text already rendered on the director (but will have to re-render new text)
		- [FIXED] Deleting an item will then crash the editor on save
		- [FIXED] PlayerSetupDialog: Clicking CONNECT before TEST crashes
		- [FIXED] PlayerSetupDialog: Must click TEST then CONNECT 2x to connect
		- [FIXED] Director: The playerlist item changed signal from the player doesnt highlight the right item
		- [FIXED] Director: Remove the fractional seconds from the director playlist time
		- [FIXED] Cross-fading between CameraThread's in GLVideoDrawable *seems* to 'fade thru black' - but only in the OpenGL painter version. The QGraphicsItem version fades front in.
			* Can't test till at a workstation with dual video inputs - tomorrow or Tuesday
			- Something to do with glBlendFunc - only fades thru black using OpenGL - using QGraphicsScene, it paints fine
			- "Fixed" by adding a CrossFadeMode enum - videos and cameras only fade the front image out, not the back image in. 
				Whereas text and images, fade front out AND back in - rather a "ductape" fix - but seems to work for now. 
		- [FIXED] Text crossfading seems to be broken - at least in player via the setProperty command - seems to set text THEN try to crossfade...
			- Problem was added when we switched to using the QSharedPointer for VideoFrames. Fixed by making a new m_frame2 in GLImageDrawable before crossfading.
		
		- Make GLDirector NOT crash when the player is disconnected!
			- Crash seems to be deep inside the Qt networking code (!!!!!!!)
			- Short of recompiling Qt, I don't have a workaround for the crash...yet...
			- Not a showstoper yet, so moving on to other problems for now.
			- Updated: Seems to not crash at the same point now - now when player closes, it gets caught in a loop in VideoReceiver - then when player comes back, THEN it crashes
			- Need to figure out where the latest crash is an if we can fix this one.
			- Seems to be caused *by* VideoReceiver - when no videoreceiver active, player can close and reopen without crashing the director
		- Director: playlist text looses formatting when playing?
		- Make the Video Input control panel in director default to last network source
			- [DONE] Consider removing "(This Machine)" as an option
				- Dont put a message box - just a simple QLabel
		- Make the video input control panel automatically update when players are connected
		- Sometimes, clicking Connect on the player doesnt fully connect - logs in, but nothing transmitted, window not moved, etc - clicking connect again works
		- Changing scenes doesnt always work in player - I'd say 1/10th of the timer, it stays black
		
	NEEDED FEATURES:
		- Make an "option" to reconfig the item control area as mini windows...?
			- So you can access the video switcher and text settings without switching between the two...?
		- Transmit slide group changes to player when editor window closed
			- Need to cross fade between slides
			- Prompt to send?
		- When an item is edited in the editor, it needs to update the filtered item list in the director
		- Need to drag/drop to re-arrange slide list
		- Add 'setup' options to the video switcher to configure the video feed from director
			- Input
			- Should these be part of the editor?
				- Flip
				- BHCS
				- Crop
		- Need to add controls to the VideoSender to remotly control transmission size/fps
		- Either (a) integrate with DViz songs.db and Bible functionality or (b) integrate VideoSender with DViz
			- Add a GroupType and SceneType to GLSceneGroup and GLScene, respectively.
				 - SceneTypes are a SceneTypeID, and the SceneTypeFactory gives a SceneTypeEngine which:
				 	- Lists the needed item names/types
				 		E.g. for a WeatherScene, it might need:
				 			#WeatherIcon	- SVG
				 			#Temp		- Text
				 			#MinTemp 	- Text
				 			#MaxTemp	- Text
				 	- Audit the scene to make sure the names above are present
				 	- Apply the content to tthe scene before going live with the scene
				 	- Generate a ControlWidget which emits a 'setProperty' signal to change settings in the director
				 	- (Maybe) Generate an EditorWidget to setup the scene in the editor
				- GroupTypes are a GroupTypeID and the GroupTypeFactor gives a GroupTypeEngine which:
					- GroupTypes use scenes as templates for generating multiple scenes 
						- Similar to above, they look for required elements in the template
						- Then they duplicate the template to make scenes in a new group
					- The new group has its GroupType set to the id of the engine
					- The engine is then responsible for generating the QAbstractListModel for the list of scenes in the group
					- The engine also gets a pointer to the list view so it can reconfig the list view as it desires
						- The default engine must be sure to reset the list view
					- Group engines can generate slides that either use the default SceneType or a custom scene type
		- Border/Dropshadow control for items
			- Right now, text and images
		- Crossfading between scenes
		- MUST have per-camera BCHS controls
		- Add copy/paste to editor
		- Add a 'remove from playlist' button
		- Durations on scenes
			- Auto calced based on max length playlist of items
			- Or manually set
		- Durations on groups
			- Auto calced based on durations of all the scenes
		- Add a "play" interface to groups to loop thru scenes
			- Some how emit a signal when need to change scenes?
		- Add a play interface to collection to loop thru groups
		
		- [DONE] Add a simple rectangle item to draw boxes, panels, lines with
		- [DONE] Make "Test Connection" just TEST in player setup
		- [DONE] Make a checkbox for "connect on startup"
		- [DONE] Add button to "Connect To" beside "Test"
		- [DONE] Transmit slide group to player when connected
		- [DONE] Add Item autofit to editor
		- [DONE] Allow player to run playlists on items by itself without being connected to the director
	
	IDEAS:
		- Add an "output analysis" to the PlayerSetupDialog
			- Auto-updated histogram when connected
			- Need a histo of rgb values not just grayscale
			- Add graphs of min/max/avg for hue/sat/value
		- Add image slow-zoom animation (zoom in/out, setc)
		- [DONE] SVG animation playback/rendering
			- Not the smoothest thing around, but it works...
		- Add a Weather Item based on Google API code in $QT_HOME/qt/demos/embedded/weatherinfo.cpp
		- Some method to auto-balance/tune camera's HSV so they match each other?
		- Adjust color curves wtih matrixes? (Not just shift entire hues/sats, but curves.)
		- Add in "Levels"/Gamma adjustment vis a vi:
			outPixel = (pow(((inPixel * 255.0) - inBlack) / (inWhite - inBlack),
                		inGamma) * (outWhite - outBlack) + outBlack) / 255.0;
                	From Graphics Gems ch 22, Fig 22-2, http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch22.html
                - Add method to VideoFrame to store a GLuint textureId so multiple GLVideoDrawables rendering the same VideoFrame don't have to upload the buffer/QImage to the video card multiple times
                	- the first drawable to get the frame checks for a textureId - if none is set, then upload the texture and set the textureId on the frame. But if one is set,
                		then use that textureId to paint the frame  
		- Text scroller
			- Renders a playlist of text items 
			- Calc the current # of items to fill the screen layed out H or V, then render that many + 1 as a QImage
				- Use QImage::copy() to render a moving rectangle
				- When one item falls off the "left", re-render
				- OR just thought of this - upload the entire rendered QImage (many+1) to a texture, then only render the subrect part of the texture by adjusting the 
				  texture coordinates of the render output (the sourc rect in updateRects())
		- HTML snippet widget
			- Embed a QWebKit widget's output for view-only content
		- Store pixmaps/images of scenes, groups, and drawables in the GLScene/GLSceneGroup/GLDrawable for rendering as icon in the appros list models
		- Get layouts working
		- Integrate with the three most used "generators" from DViz:
			- Bible
			- Songs
			- Image Slideshows
			- Each generates a GLSceneGroup containing multiple GLScenes with appros GLDrawables to represent the content
		- Undo/redo
		- Idea: Can we reduce network latency by breaking the frame apart into subsections and transmitting them in parallel over seperate sockets?

Target: pixelrevo-player
	Components:
		Core:
			GLWidget / GLDrawable
				Drawable Items:
					GLVideoInputDrawable (done)
						- TODO:
							Crossfading doesnt *quite* work smoothly enough -
							I think this is due to the initaliztion of the V4L subsystem for the second camera - if the V4L input is already open, it *should* crossfade fine....
					GLVideoLoopDrawable (done)
					GLVideoFileDrawable (done)
						- TODO: 
							Add properties for:
								- play/pause/ff/rw/etc
								- Add seek method/slots
								- Query play time for remote controllers
					GLVideoReceiverDrawable (done)
					GLImageDrawable (done)
					GLTextDrawable (done)
						- TODO:
							Add properties for text shadow / color etc
					GLRectDrawable
					GLVideoMjpegDrawable (done)
				Todo Items:
					- (done) Add native cross fading support in GLVideoDrawable (since all items above will probably derive from GLVideoDrawable)
					- (done) Add a 'transmit video' property to Video(input|file) drawables
						- Called it 'videoSenderEnabled' - automatically allocates port if none set explicitly, starting from 7755 and up (tests to see if port is in use.) Port used can be queried from 'videoSenderPort' property, or set using same proprty.
					- Add dropshadow support for image/text/rect
					- Add outline support for image/text/rect/videos
					- Add (explicit?) property animations for GLDrawable rect/opac props
					- Consider adding a GLWebDrawable .. ? (idea: Use the proxy method used in DViz to render using QWebView off screen and feed frames as a video source...?)
					
			Data Structure:
				Schedule
					Each Schedule Entry Specifies a:
						- SceneGroup
							- Scene in that group
								- Layout in that scene
									- Sets the 'user' property on one or more drawables in that scene
									- Set the visibility of an item
						- The duration of that schedule entry can be either:
							- A. Automatically Calculated (Implicit Duration)
								- The longest explicit or implicit duration of the media in every user property set in this Schedule Entry is the automatic/Implicit duration of the schedule entry
								- If this schedule entry is assigned a date/time, and the next entry assigned a datetime is closer than the automatic duration, this entry will only "play" until
								  the next date/time schedule entry is scheduled to "play"
							- B. Manually Set
								- If no implicit duration can be calculated, or the user desires to override the duration, the duration can be manualy set
								- However, the next hard-scheduled (date/time assigned) schedule item to come up will go live, even if this entry still has manually-specified time left to play
						- The date/time the Schedule Entry ("Item") is to play
							- The date/time can be implicit or manual ("locked")
								- If implicit, it will still be assigned a date/time, but only for human reference, based on the cumulative duration of the previously scheduled items added from the last "locked" schedule item
									- Implicit date/timed items will play immediately following the previously playing entry
									- Implicit items will NOT cut into a previously playing item - they will allow the full duration of the previous item to occur
								- Locked date/time items will cut into previously playing items to play when that date/time occurs
						
						- If, when the duration of the item playing is completed, and the next item is a "locked"/manually-set date/time item, and it is not yet that date/time, then the last implicit item following the most recet locked date/time items should play, in essence "looping" until the next "locked" date/time item
						
						- Since the Schedule Entry can specify the user property of even just one item and leave the rest unchanged, a previously playing drawable will retain its existing user property even though another drawables' user prop is scheduled to change, in effect creating overlapping schedule items.
				
				The SchedulePlayer reads the list of ScheduleItems from the active Schedule and implements the required timing logic, honoring implicit/explicit duratiosn and date/times, effecting the property/visibility changes and scenegroup/scene/layout changes as needed
					SchedulePlayer therefore needs the ability to:
						- Locate SceneGroups
							- By 'ID' or File, however they are specified in the schedule
				
				SceneGroup
					- <list of drawables>
					Scene
						- <list of drawables>
						- <list of layouts, one or more>
							- each layout contains a list of properties for each drawable in the Scene
								- rect
								- visible/not visible
								- opacity
								- (other related visual properties)
								- a qvariant 'user' property (for the user controllable property value, such as the image file to show, etc)
								
		
		Playing Functionality:
			- Two things to 'play':
				- inputs for the drawables (videos/images/etc)
				- the entire layout
					- Structure Concept:
						- Scene
							- All the elements as a bulk collection
							- Layout
								- Positions elements, shows/hides elements
			- Need a controller which:
				- loads playlists for each item and for layout
				- syncs changes to clock
				- listens for changes to playlist object and reloads accordingly
				
			- Need playlist object:
				- list of playlist items
					- item:
						- drawableId & propName/value
						- 
						
			
					





Update GLDrawable to either support:
	- Blue Alpha Blending
		- Already supports alpha masks
		- Use the blue channel (or some other channel) to control blending the pixel between BLACK and the texture color
		- This would allow drawing black lines on top of the texture using the alpha mask, instead of requiring a third texture for an overlay (in addition to the alpha mask)
	- Or a third texture for overlay on top of the alpha mask
		
Update VideoThread to support HD
	Need to create a variable length buffer
	Move timing code into buffer control
	Selectivly hold frames if falling behind 
	
	Also, get YUV420P working in raw format to allow YUV conversion on the GPU
