	BUGS:
		- Director: playlist keeps playing after switching slides...?
		- Director: playlist text looses formatting when playing?
		- Director: After closing editor, the slide never re-appears in director view, even after clicking the slide again in the list
		- Editor: Sometimes an item gets "stuck" while "selected" - and no wway to click it and get it to emit a selected signal again even after adding items or clicking other items
		- [FIXED] For some reason, changing lots of subview values (e.g. drag sliders) causes the player to "bog down" - is something not getting deleted properly on player?
		- [CONFIRMED] Make sure that video threads are getting deleted on player when changing videos
		- [DONE] Rewrite VideoFrame and all usages to either inherit from QSharedData or some other pointer class
			Because a race condition seems to develop when two video drawables attempt to use the same video source (such as a CameraThread) - and somehow C++ seems to call the 
			destructor on VideoFrame causing a SIUGSEGV deep in QByteArray
		- When viewing remote using vid send/receiver thru a VideoWidget, one of the video streams seems to 'back up' and only "unspools" when sent live thru a GLVideoDrawable... ???
		
	NEEDED FEATURES:
		- Fade speed control
		- Need to set canvas size of the groups
		- Add 'setup' options to the video switcher to configure the video feed from director
			- Input
			- Should these be part of the editor?
				- Flip
				- BHCS
				- Crop
		[DONE] - VideoSender/Receiver needs to be able to degrade quality over network to reduce bandwidth, reduce latency, and increase fps to ~10fps minimum
			[DONE] - Reduce transmission fps to minimum (10)
			[DONE] - Scale image down for transmission 
		- Either (a) integrate with DViz songs.db and Bible functionality or (b) integrate VideoSender with DViz
		- Border/Dropshadow control for items
			- Right now, text and images
		- Black button
		- Make GLDirector NOT crash when the player is disconnected!
		- Preview feed back from the player - what's really on the screen 
	
	IDEAS:
		- Text scroller
			- Renders a playlist of text items 
			- Calc the current # of items to fill the screen layed out H or V, then render that many + 1 as a QImage
				- Use QImage::copy() to render a moving rectangle
				- When one item falls off the "left", re-render
		- HTML snippet widget
			- Embed a QWebKit widget's output for view-only content
		- Store pixmaps/images of scenes, groups, and drawables in the GLScene/GLSceneGroup/GLDrawable for rendering as icon in the appros list models
		- Get layouts working
		- Integrate with the three most used "generators" from DViz:
			- Bible
			- Songs
			- Image Slideshows
			- Each generates a GLSceneGroup containing multiple GLScenes with appros GLDrawables to represent the content
		- Add item layout helpers to editor
			[DONE] - Center H/V
			[DONE] - Text autofit
			- Item autofit 
		- Add copy/paste

			- Load scene groups and play the required group/scene/layout on demand over network
				- TASKS:
					[DONE] Create a GLPlayerServer class, feature bullets:
						Listen on a port

							Data block is a byte array for a QVariantMap
							Required Map Keys:
								- Sequence # (auto incremented number)
								- Command (e.g. loadSlideGroup, etc. - compile a list of valid comments)
								- QVariantMap is passed enmass as a ref (&) to the command
								- Command should be a slot that accepts a QVariantMap 
							Think of commands as slot calls
						Responds to conected client ala a signal
							GLPlayerServer should have a slot that can be called with a QVariantMap 
								One of the keys should be a "responseName"
								The client should function like the server, responses are slots that accept a QVariantMap
					[DONE] Create command slots for the GLPlayerServer class:
						- Functions needed:

Target: pixelrevo-player
	Components:
		Core:
			GLWidget / GLDrawable
				Drawable Items:
					GLVideoInputDrawable (done)
						- TODO:
							Crossfading doesnt *quite* work smoothly enough -
							I think this is due to the initaliztion of the V4L subsystem for the second camera - if the V4L input is already open, it *should* crossfade fine....
					GLVideoLoopDrawable (done)
					GLVideoFileDrawable (done)
						- TODO: 
							Add properties for:
								- play/pause/ff/rw/etc
								- Add seek method/slots
								- Query play time for remote controllers
					GLVideoReceiverDrawable (done)
					GLImageDrawable (done)
					GLTextDrawable (done)
						- TODO:
							Add properties for text shadow / color etc
					GLRectDrawable
					GLVideoMjpegDrawable (done)
				Todo Items:
					- (done) Add native cross fading support in GLVideoDrawable (since all items above will probably derive from GLVideoDrawable)
					- (done) Add a 'transmit video' property to Video(input|file) drawables
						- Called it 'videoSenderEnabled' - automatically allocates port if none set explicitly, starting from 7755 and up (tests to see if port is in use.) Port used can be queried from 'videoSenderPort' property, or set using same proprty.
					- Add dropshadow support for image/text/rect
					- Add outline support for image/text/rect/videos
					- Add (explicit?) property animations for GLDrawable rect/opac props
					- Consider adding a GLWebDrawable .. ? (idea: Use the proxy method used in DViz to render using QWebView off screen and feed frames as a video source...?)
					
			Data Structure:
				Schedule
					Each Schedule Entry Specifies a:
						- SceneGroup
							- Scene in that group
								- Layout in that scene
									- Sets the 'user' property on one or more drawables in that scene
									- Set the visibility of an item
						- The duration of that schedule entry can be either:
							- A. Automatically Calculated (Implicit Duration)
								- The longest explicit or implicit duration of the media in every user property set in this Schedule Entry is the automatic/Implicit duration of the schedule entry
								- If this schedule entry is assigned a date/time, and the next entry assigned a datetime is closer than the automatic duration, this entry will only "play" until
								  the next date/time schedule entry is scheduled to "play"
							- B. Manually Set
								- If no implicit duration can be calculated, or the user desires to override the duration, the duration can be manualy set
								- However, the next hard-scheduled (date/time assigned) schedule item to come up will go live, even if this entry still has manually-specified time left to play
						- The date/time the Schedule Entry ("Item") is to play
							- The date/time can be implicit or manual ("locked")
								- If implicit, it will still be assigned a date/time, but only for human reference, based on the cumulative duration of the previously scheduled items added from the last "locked" schedule item
									- Implicit date/timed items will play immediately following the previously playing entry
									- Implicit items will NOT cut into a previously playing item - they will allow the full duration of the previous item to occur
								- Locked date/time items will cut into previously playing items to play when that date/time occurs
						
						- If, when the duration of the item playing is completed, and the next item is a "locked"/manually-set date/time item, and it is not yet that date/time, then the last implicit item following the most recet locked date/time items should play, in essence "looping" until the next "locked" date/time item
						
						- Since the Schedule Entry can specify the user property of even just one item and leave the rest unchanged, a previously playing drawable will retain its existing user property even though another drawables' user prop is scheduled to change, in effect creating overlapping schedule items.
				
				The SchedulePlayer reads the list of ScheduleItems from the active Schedule and implements the required timing logic, honoring implicit/explicit duratiosn and date/times, effecting the property/visibility changes and scenegroup/scene/layout changes as needed
					SchedulePlayer therefore needs the ability to:
						- Locate SceneGroups
							- By 'ID' or File, however they are specified in the schedule
				
				SceneGroup
					- <list of drawables>
					Scene
						- <list of drawables>
						- <list of layouts, one or more>
							- each layout contains a list of properties for each drawable in the Scene
								- rect
								- visible/not visible
								- opacity
								- (other related visual properties)
								- a qvariant 'user' property (for the user controllable property value, such as the image file to show, etc)
								
		
		Playing Functionality:
			- Two things to 'play':
				- inputs for the drawables (videos/images/etc)
				- the entire layout
					- Structure Concept:
						- Scene
							- All the elements as a bulk collection
							- Layout
								- Positions elements, shows/hides elements
			- Need a controller which:
				- loads playlists for each item and for layout
				- syncs changes to clock
				- listens for changes to playlist object and reloads accordingly
				
			- Need playlist object:
				- list of playlist items
					- item:
						- drawableId & propName/value
						- 
						
			
					





Update GLDrawable to either support:
	- Blue Alpha Blending
		- Already supports alpha masks
		- Use the blue channel (or some other channel) to control blending the pixel between BLACK and the texture color
		- This would allow drawing black lines on top of the texture using the alpha mask, instead of requiring a third texture for an overlay (in addition to the alpha mask)
	- Or a third texture for overlay on top of the alpha mask
		
Update VideoThread to support HD
	Need to create a variable length buffer
	Move timing code into buffer control
	Selectivly hold frames if falling behind 
	
	Also, get YUV420P working in raw format to allow YUV conversion on the GPU
