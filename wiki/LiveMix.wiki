= Code Moved =

== Active development for LiveMix and related code has been moved to a separate project: [http://code.google.com/p/livepro/ http://code.google.com/p/livepro/] ==

=== Note ===

LiveMix maintains integration with DViz through "raw" outputs in DViz (in File->Program Settings->Output Setup, set whatever output you would like to enable "MJPEG" output, set FPS to one below "0", which would display "Raw"). DViz uses this mode to send frames to LiveMix for use as lower-thirds or full-screen CG visuals.

= About LiveMix =

LiveMix is an video switching program which was developed as a companion to DViz.

It's designed for time-critical performance, especially with regards to live video feeds from capture cards. Reducing latency from the card to the screen is a key design goal in this program.
